# Helper scripts

A collection of scripts to help with the analysis of datAFLow (and regular AFL)
results.

## Usage

Probably best to add the path to this directory to your Python path. E.g.,

```bash
cd datAFLow/scripts
export PYTHONPATH=`pwd`:$PYTHONPATH
```

Then run the scripts as follows:

```bash
python -m dataflow_stats --help
```
